Add iOS Simulator and real device support for mobile Safari testing via Appium. New CLI commands include `device list` to show available simulators, `tap` and `swipe` for touch interactions, and the `--device` flag to specify which iOS device to use. Configure with `-p ios` provider flag or `AGENT_BROWSER_PROVIDER=ios` environment variable.
